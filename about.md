Hi, my name is Greg! Most of my coding experience is in web development, both back and front end, but I have worked on many other projects in my time. My favorite non-web language has to be `c++` as I love the idea of being able to writing super efficient code while still using a high-level language.

Aside from just stringing lines of code together, I enjoy taking part in [CTFs](../ctfs), building model rockets, and occasionally exposing myself to deadly carcinogens (not intentionally).

### More Information

Only joking, that is for now.

### Contact me

Don't, actually.

If you're interested in any of my posts though feel free to use the comments section, otherwise I can provide contact details upon request :)
